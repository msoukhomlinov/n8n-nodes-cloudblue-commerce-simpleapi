        [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)
        interface. In addition to this API specification, use the following resources:

        Basic authentication is a simple authentication scheme built into the
                HTTP protocol. The client sends HTTP requests with the `Authorization`
                header that contains the word Basic followed by a space and a
                base64-encoded string username:password.

        Bearer authentication (also called token authentication) is an HTTP
                authentication scheme that involves security tokens called bearer
                tokens. The name "Bearer authentication" can be understood as "give
                access to the bearer of this token." The bearer token is a cryptic
                string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request.
                The client must send this token in the `Authorization` header when
                making requests to protected resources.
